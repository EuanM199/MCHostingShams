# Minecraft Hosting shame list
This list was created to document some of the failings in certain hosting companies,
please do not attack these sites, we only ask that the hosting services learn from these mistakes and change them

To add a host, create a PR request :)


* Shockbyte "Terrible Support that can take up to a week to respond to a simple ticket, still sends you emails 1 year after you cancel your subscription and email"

* Pebblehost "seems great on the surface, but if you need support expect to be told the same 3 things to check the spigot guide, showed you purpur, or told you to upgrade your plan, has a script running on every server that checks if you have "backup.zip" and deletes them, and completely oversells their nodes like mad"
