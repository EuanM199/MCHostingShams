# Minecraft Hosting shame list
This list was created to document some of the failings in certain hosting companies,
please do not attack these sites, we only ask that the hosting services learn from these mistakes and change them

To add a host, create a PR request :)

* Shockbyte "Terrible Support that can take up to a week to respond to a simple ticket, still sends you emails 1 year after you cancel your subscription and email"

* Pebblehost "seems great on the surface, but if you need support expect to be told the same 3 things over and over,  To check the spigot guide, show you purpur or tunity, or tell you to upgrade your plan, has a script running on every server that checks if you have "backup.zip" and deletes them, and completely oversells their nodes like mad"

* Slothhost "Owner sadly ran away with all the funds from the server and left the brand new staff to deal with the angry mob of customers who lost all their data"

* TitanNodes "CEO acts like a child quite a lot of the time, other than that, very solid servers."

* GG servers "They require people go into paypal subscriptions and cancel there, which causes people to cancel on their site just to end up being charged for months afterwards, with 0 refunds.  have "lost" peoples entire servers before"

* Boxtoplay "Deletes Server critical plugins like coreprotect unless you contact support, with 0 warning to users"

* Scalacube "CPU pinned at 100% constantly, server runs like a slideshow"

* KudoHosting "went bankrupt without alerting users, giving them 0 chance to download their servers"

* Minehut "Runs all "free" servers under the same network, but made the mistake of having all servers running under the same directory allowing plugins like skript access to mess with other servers, only allows whitelisted plugins, that are forked versions with update checks removed leaving plugins massively outdated"

* VPScraft "Limits server connections to databases causing servers to get blocked from them and support takes 1 month to fix"

* Sparkedhost "Most of their plans are known to not perform good (most likely overselling), every node has their own different specs, making your performance basically based on luck, "Unlimited storage" scam and is known to have bought competing host companies and terminated them."

* Nodecraft "Support isn't great and there prices are absolutely horrible (10$/gb for some plans)"
