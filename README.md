# Minecraft Hosting shame list
This list was created to document some of the failings in certain hosting companies,
please do not attack these sites, we only ask that the hosting services learn from these mistakes and change them

To add a host, create a PR request :)

* Shockbyte "Terrible Support that can take up to a week to respond to a simple ticket, still sends you emails 1 year after you cancel your subscription and email"

* Pebblehost "seems great on the surface, but if you need support expect to be told the same 3 things over and over,  To check the spigot guide, show you purpur or tunity, or tell you to upgrade your plan, has a script running on every server that checks if you have "backup.zip" and deletes them, and completely oversells their nodes like mad"

* Slothhost "Owner sadly ran away with all the funds from the server and left the brand new staff to deal with the angry mob of customers who lost all their data"
